*Disclaimer: It's in developers only mode*

## How to do it?
1. Get the location of wildfire happening from [NASA's](https://api.nasa.gov/) API freely available!
2. Use [Google maps API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/) to map out all the obtained location
3. Mark the location by 🔥 emoji 
4. Whenever user clicks any 🔥 emoji show details like location and ID for that information
5. User can zoom in and look any location from his fingertips

## Things that I needed to develop
- ReactJS
- EONET API
- Gmaps API

That's it! there you have a well crafted website to show wildfire location.
